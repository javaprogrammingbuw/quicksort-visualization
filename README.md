# Todo:
* The user can enter numeric values into the textfield. Yout program should work for all primitive numeric data types(Double, Float, Integer, ...)
* Don't forget to check if the user input is valid (What if the user enters letters?)
* Sort the entered values with the QuickSort Algorithm
  * **Note: There are many QuickSort implementations online. Don't use an already existing implementation, you have to implement and to understand the algorithm!**
* Visualize the steps of the algorithm (Number of Iterations, Pivot Element, List, Sublists, ...)
